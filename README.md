Zoom-AVS
========

Simple process automation tool that doesn't sacrifice flexibility.


There are many repeatable tasks that we do during life that vary just a little bit everytime.


Full automation is fast but hard to update and isn't flexible. It also need tedious error checking.

Partial automation still offers a quicker solution but give you the flexibility to deal with the real world.  Zoom offers a partial automation solution that is easy to update. You can skip tasks easily. It helps you type in strings of text, copy files, delete files, and run EXEs. 

Features:

Modes!
Use the same script for your development instance as your production instance. Just change the mode. You can use this to substitute server names, file paths, and more. 

Script Variable!
This variable is put into the script during runtime. It is not saved with the script. Put that utility account password in there and Zoom will type it the 10 different times you want to add it. Or you can put other information in there that will be different every time you run the script.


I have created a youtube playlist showing how to use Zoom.
