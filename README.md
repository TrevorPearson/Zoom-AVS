Zoom-AVS
========

Simple process automation tool that doesn't sacrifice flexibility.

With this tool you can create task chains on the fly. There is a pause between every step so not everything needs to be automated. 
There are many repeatable tasks that we do during life that vary just a little bit everytime.  Full automation is fast but hard to update and isn't flexible and can be dangerous. Zoom shows you everything it will do before you run the next task so there are no surpises.

Partial automation still offers a quicker solution but gives you the flexibility to deal with the real world.  Zoom offers a partial automation solution that is easy to update. You can skip tasks easily. It helps you type in strings of text, copy files, delete files, and run EXEs. 

Features:
----------

Modes!
Use the same script for your development instance as your production instance. Just change the mode. You can use this to substitute server names, file paths, and more. 

Script Variable!
This variable is put into the script during runtime. It is not saved with the script. Put that utility account password in there and Zoom will type it the 10 different times you want to add it. Or you can put other information in there that will be different every time you run the script.

AutoIt Script!
Sometimes things are complex and you need to do something unexpected. You can now put in a line of code as a command which gives you the most flexibility.

I have created a youtube playlist showing how to use Zoom.
